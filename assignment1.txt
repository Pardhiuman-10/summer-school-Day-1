- <form>: This is used to collect user input.
- <label>: Gives a name to each form input, making it easier to understand.
- <input>: Allows users to type in or select data. I used different types for different kinds of information.
- <textarea>: A bigger text box for users to type more detailed answers.
- <button>: Used to submit the form.
- <br>: break element represents line break

2. Why I Chose Specific Input Types

- type="text": I used this for names and short answers because it’s best for single-line input.
- type="email": This checks if the email is in the correct format, which helps with validation.
- type="password": Hides what the user types in for privacy and security.
- type="radio": Great for selecting only one option from a few choices, like a multiple-choice question.
- type="checkbox": Lets users select multiple options at once, like selecting interests or hobbies.
- type="submit": This was used to create the button that sends the form data.

3. How My Navigation Structure Works

We use a <nav> element inside the <header> to organize the main links. Each link uses an <a> tag and either points to different sections of the page using #section-id or links to other pages. This makes it easy for users to find what they need quickly without scrolling too much. The navigation is simple and consistent across all pages.
